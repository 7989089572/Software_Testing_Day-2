# ðŸ“š Day 2 â€“ Software Testing Roadmap: Basics

## Date: September 24, 2025

Today I continued my learning journey in **Software Testing** and explored some very important QA concepts and testing fundamentals.

## ðŸ”¹ Topics Covered

### 1. Quality Assurance Standards

**âœ… What is Quality Assurance (QA)?**  
- QA is a **process-oriented activity** that ensures the software development process follows proper standards, methods, and best practices.  
- **Purpose:** Deliver a quality product.  
- QA is **preventive** â€“ it aims to prevent defects **before** they occur.  
- Focuses on **improving the development and testing process**.

**Example:**  
Imagine a pizza shop. QA ensures:
- The dough recipe is correct.  
- Ingredients are fresh and measured properly.  
- Cooking process follows the standard.

### 2. QA vs QC

| **QA (Quality Assurance)** | **QC (Quality Control)** |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Process-oriented           | Product-oriented         |
| Prevents defects           | Detects defects          |
| Focus on **process improvement** | Focus on **testing output** |

### 3. QA Standards

- **ISO (International Organization for Standardization)**  
- **CMMI Levels (Capability Maturity Model Integration)**  

**Purpose of Standards:**  
- Ensure consistent quality.  
- Provide frameworks for auditing and improvement.

### âœ… Key Takeaways

- QA is **not just testing**, it is a preventive approach.  
- Following QA standards ensures fewer defects and better quality.  
- QA improves the **process**, QC ensures the **product meets quality expectations**.

### ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

- Learn more about **Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)**.  
- Explore **Manual Testing techniques**.  
- Start **practical exercises** to identify defects in sample applications.
